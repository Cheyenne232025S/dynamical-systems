# Dynamical Systems 
This is a collection of dynamical system problem solutions written in LateX. This was done with a partner (Maya Datoc) every week for an entire semester.

All problem sets where provided by Professor Werner and all MATLAB code associated to problem solutions where done by me (Cheyenne Erickson). 

Below is a brief description of the system Maya and I used to effectively and efficeintly turn in these written up (LaTex) assignments for extra credit. 
- Each of us did the homework on our own time in the beggining of each week
- We would meet every Thursday (occasionally Wednesday or Friday), discuss and compare our solutions
- divide and assign the 5 problems to be written up in LaTex and turned in by 11:59 each Friday. We would take turns who wrote up 3/5 problems.
  
It took a couple weeks for us to find the best system for us, so the first two Sets only have the solutions that I written up for the LaTax extra credit; Set 3 and onward we moved to a collaborative overLeaf, so the full solutions will be presented to you.


Overall this appraoch was very successful, and it was really benefical to solidfying the material I was learning as I often would explain my answers to my partner. Additionally, wirtting up the solutions helped that cause as it forced me to think about it again and deliever the answer in a consice and percise way.
